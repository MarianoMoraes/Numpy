# Numerical programming exercises.


- Exercise 1
Create a function that, given a one-dimensional array, gives a basic statistical summary of the data. If it detects that the array has more than one dimension, it must display an error message.


- Exercise 2
Create a function that generates an NxN square of random names between 0 and 100.


- Exercise 3
Create a function that, given a table of two dimensions (NxM), calculates the totals per row and the totals per column.


- Exercise 4
Manually implement a function that calculates the correlation coefficient. Inform yourself about its uses and interpretation.
